## Uber churn rate study

Quicklook: Feature engineering, data cleaning, EDA with k-means clustering, Random Forest, Boosting, Logistic regression.


Using k-means clustering to explore group differences in churn rate, discovered several variables of interest that differs between high churn rate group and low churn rate group. Successfully inferred that recreational users tend to have higher churn rate than commuters as they experiences greater surge rate and higher percentages of surge than week-day users. 

Comparing results from random forest, boosting and logistic regression, built a optimized model that predicted whether a user would churn at 83 percent accuracy. 

Using results from the finding, we made business recommendations ranging from offering promotions to recreational users ($5 off for next 10 rides) to fixing up mobile app on the android platform.
